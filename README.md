# Transfer Review History

Transfers the review history from one card to another

Allows transferring the review history from one card to another, for example when you created a newer, better card, but don't want to update an existing card or relearn anything on this card.

You can either merge or replace the review history on the target and can also automatically let the old card get deleted.

## Compatibility

Tested with 23.10.0 / 23.10.1, earlier versions may work.
